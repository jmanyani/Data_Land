# Data_Land
This repository contains my data engineering work, including hands-on projects, learning experiments, and real-world implementations. It covers topics such as data ingestion, transformation, and storage using tools like Apache Spark, Kafka, SQL, and cloud data services. The goal is to design and build scalable, reliable, and efficient data pipelines for analytics and machine learning.
